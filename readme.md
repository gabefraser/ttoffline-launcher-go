# Toontown Offline Launcher

[![Generate release-artifacts](https://github.com/gabefraser/ttoffline-launcher-go/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gabefraser/ttoffline-launcher-go/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This is an unofficial launcher I built as the current one struggles from downloading issues.

Feel free to take a look at the source code.

## Usage

You can add the `--dedicated` flag to the executable to start the server straight from the launcher.

Windows
```
ttoff-launcher.exe [--dedicated]
```

Linux/MacOS
```
ttoff-launcher [--dedicated]
```
