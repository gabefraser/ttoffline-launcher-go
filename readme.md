# Toontown Offline Launcher

[![release](https://github.com/gabefraser/ttoffline-launcher-go/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gabefraser/ttoffline-launcher-go/actions/workflows/release.yml)

This is an unofficial launcher I built as the current one struggles from downloading issues.

Feel free to take a look at the source code.

## Usage

Download the latest binary for your operating system of choice [here](https://github.com/gabefraser/ttoffline-launcher-go/releases).

You can add the `--dedicated` flag to the executable to start the server straight from the launcher.

Windows
```
ttoff-launcher-windows-amd64.exe [--dedicated]
```

Linux - UNTESTED
```
ttoff-launcher-linux-amd64 [--dedicated]
```

Mac - UNTESTED
```
ttoff-launcher-mac-amd64 [--dedicated]
```
